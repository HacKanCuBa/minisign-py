# Minisign Python

This is a pure Python implementation of [Frank Denis](https://twitter.com/jedisct1/)' [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/).

**I moved the repo to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/hackancuba/minisign-py), so this repo will eventually become a mirror. For the time being, please go to the [Gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/hackancuba/minisign-py).**

## Goals

* Compatible public interface: all commands and options must be 100% compatible and with same results.
* Usage as CLI and as Python module.
* Follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

### Secondary goals

* Small amount of dependencies (I would love to keep it just to cryptolibraries).
* If possible, maintain current active Python versions (3.7+).
